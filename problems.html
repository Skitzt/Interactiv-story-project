                    <h3>According to a report by the Social Mobility Commission, child poverty in the UK is on the rise, with four million children living below the poverty line. This statistic reveals the stark reality faced by many families and highlights the urgent need for measures to alleviate poverty and provide equal opportunities for all.</h3>
            <h3>Moreover, research conducted by the Office for National Statistics shows that income inequality in the UK is among the highest in Europe. The richest 1% of the population owns nearly a quarter of the country's wealth, while those in lower income brackets struggle to make ends meet. </h3>
