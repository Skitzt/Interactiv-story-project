       <p>Oliver faces yet another crossroads on his journey - to collaborate with like-minded individuals or continue his fight alone. <br> 
        Understanding the importance of collective action, Oliver recognizes that the strength of unity lies in its ability to dismantle the walls of inequality. <br>
        He must decide whether to prioritize his personal ambition or embrace the power of solidarity. <br>
        <br>
        Oliver reflects on the significance of teamwork and collaboration in addressing society's core challenges. <br>
        Recognizing that no single person can single-handedly dismantle the structures of oppression, he seeks to forge alliances with those who share his vision.<br>
        The consequences of his choice are profound - collaboration magnifies the impact of their collective efforts, while standing alone risks diluting his purpose and stunting the trajectory of change.
