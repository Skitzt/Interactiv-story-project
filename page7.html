            <h2>Advocate for Social Change or Accept the Status Quo</h2>
            <p>Oliver faces a new challenge - whether to advocate for social change or conform to the existing class system.</p>
            <p>Supported by relevant facts and statistics on social inequality data from statista reveals that only 23% of students from disadvantaged backgrounds in the UK have access to private education, further entrenching the class divide.</p>
            <p>Oliver contemplates the consequences of his choice. Advocating for social change entails raising awareness about poverty and inequality, challenging the status quo, and fighting for a fairer society. Conversely, accepting the status quo perpetuates systemic injustice and reinforces the divisions within society. Oliver contemplates the consequences of his choice.
