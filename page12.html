        <p>Driven by a quiet determination, Oliver chooses to stand alone with his flicker of justice against poverty and the class system. <br>
            He believes in the power of individual agency and embarks on a solitary journey, but he is all alone and because of that he gets angry in his car after 3 months of hard work, with no result and crashes into a car on the road.<br>
             Oliver got a bill for severely injuring a family and now he canâ€™t do anything with his resources, and to the end he follows everybody else, to just have a little comfortable life. </p>
