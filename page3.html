    <h2>Privat school</h2>
</div>
        <p>Oliver gets offered to a secure place in a prestigious private school at Eton high school because of a limited event for poor people, and the world may appear to open up before him. <br>
            Surrounded by affluence and privilege, he is swept into an unknown place of exclusivity and entitlement.<br>
             Yet, as Oliver settles into this new environment, he finds himself grappling with a different set of challenges.<br>
              The pressure to conform, the weight of expectations, and the glaring inequality within the school gates threaten to suffocate his spirit.<br>
               Despite the advantages, Oliver realizes that the social divisions perpetuated by private education negate the principles of equal opportunities. </p>
