            <p>Opting for public education, Oliver finds himself within the walls of Waterford Secondary School. <br>
                The school has outdated infrastructure and overcrowded classrooms, with peeling paint and worn-out desks.<br>
                 Situated in the heart of the working-class neighborhood, the school stands as a symbol of the challenges that students from disadvantaged backgrounds face.<br>
                  The lack of resources and overcrowding hinder Oliver's academic development and affect his self-esteem. </p>
