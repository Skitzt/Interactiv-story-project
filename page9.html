       <div class="container"> <h2>Accept the Status Quo</h2></div>
        <p>As Oliver contemplates accepting the status quo, a sense of resignation washes over him. The weight of the systemic inequalities he has witnessed throughout his life feels insurmountable, and the prospect of fighting against it seems futile. Oliver begins to believe that accepting his place within the class system is the only logical choice.   </p>
        <p>He resigns himself to a life where he complies with the expectations laid out for him, where he steers clear of challenging the structures that keep him and countless others trapped in poverty. Oliver becomes a bystander, watching as the cycle of inequality continues, perpetuating the same disparities he once hoped to overcome. It is a path marked by mediocrity and unfulfilled potential, leaving Oliver feeling defeated and complacent.  </p>
