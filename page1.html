            <h3>Private school</h3>
            <p>Oliver receives a scholarship offer to attend a prestigious private school, located in the bustling city of London.<br>
                On the one hand, private schools like Eton College offer an exclusive and elitist educational experience. <br>
                The private school Oliver is offered admission to is situated on a picturesque countryside estate, surrounded by vast green landscapes. <br>
                However, the financial burden and limited access to those from less affluent backgrounds pose significant challenges. </p>
     
           <h3>Public school</h3>
           <p>Alternatively, Oliver's neighborhood is served by a public school called Waterford Secondary School.<br> 
            This school is located in a modest building, surrounded by the rowhouses and community center of the working-class neighborhood.<br>
            Though lacking the grandeur of private schools, Waterford Secondary School aims to provide a high-quality education to a broader range of students. </p>
